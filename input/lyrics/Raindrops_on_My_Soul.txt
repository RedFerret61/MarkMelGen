# Rain-drops on My Soul 
# Noc-turne for a Lost Love / Rain-drops on My Soul / Mel-an-chol-y Waltz
INTRO
In the qui-et of the eve-ning hour #
When shad-ows dance like fall-ing flow-ers # transpose(intro,1,3)

VERSE
I sit be-side the eb-o-ny keys #
And let my fin-gers find the mel-o-dies # invert(verse,1,Db4)
That speak the words my heart can-not say #
Of love that slipped like mu-sic away # reverse(verse,3)

PRECHORUS
Each note a tear, each chord a sigh #
Float-ing up-ward to the star-lit sky # transpose(prechorus,1,-2)

CHORUS
Play, sweet pia-no, sing my lone-ly song #
Of ten-der mo-ments that have come and gone # invert(chorus,1,Ab4)
In mi-nor keys I find my tru-est voice #
When si-lence was my on-ly, on-ly choice # reverse(chorus,3)

VERSE
The can-dle flick-ers by the mu-sic stand # 9 syllables
Like mem-o-ries I can-not un-der-stand # transpose(verse,2,4)
Polish lul-la-bies my moth-er sang # 8 syllables
Still ech-o where the cry-stal chan-de-liers hang # invert(verse,4,F4)

Each note a tear, each chord a sigh # 7 syllables
Float-ing up-ward to the star-lit sky # 8 syllables

CHORUS

Of ten-der mo-ments that have come and gone # 9 syllables

SOLO
I sit be-side the eb-o-ny keys # copy(verse,1)
And let my fin-gers find the mel-o-dies # invert(verse,2,Db4)
That speak the words my heart can-not say # transpose(verse,3,5)
Of love that slipped like mu-sic away # reverse(verse,4)

BRIDGE
Some-times the no-ble heart must break #
For beau-ty's and for art-is-try's sake # invert(bridge,1,Eb4)
In Po-land's fields or Pa-ris streets #
The soul finds what the spir-it needs # transpose(bridge,3,-3)

In the qui-et of the eve-ning hour # 9 syllables
When shad-ows dance like fall-ing flow-ers # transpose(intro,2,6)
The pia-no sings what words can-not say # 8 syllables
Of love that lives though you have gone away # reverse(outro,3)
