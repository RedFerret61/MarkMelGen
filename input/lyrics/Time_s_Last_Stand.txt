INTRO
The earth trem-bles be-neath our feet #
As the final hour draws near, com-plete # transpose(intro,1,4)

VERSE
In the shad-ows of a dy-ing world #
Where the last hopes have been unfurled # invert(verse,1,Eb4)
Steel and con-crete rise like mon-u-ments #
To hu-man-i-ty's last de-fi-ance # reverse(verse,3)

PRECHORUS
We are fall-ing, we are ris-ing #
Through the dark-ness, com-pro-mis-ing # transpose(prechorus,1,-2)

CHORUS
Time's last stand a-gainst e-ter-ni-ty #
Fight-ing for our mor-tal-i-ty # invert(chorus,1,Bb4)
In the si-lence af-ter the storm #
A new world waits to be born # reverse(chorus,3)

Yet from ru-ins we shall build a-gain # 8 syllables
Hope sur-vives where an-gels fear to tread # invert(verse,4,F4)

SOLO
In the shad-ows of a dy-ing world # copy(verse,1)
Where the last hopes have been unfurled # invert(verse,2,Eb4)

From the ash-es of what we knew #
