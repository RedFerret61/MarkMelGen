INTRO
Dum dum da da da dum dum da da #
Dum dum da da da dum dum da da # copy(intro,1)

VERSE 1
A lone-ly fig-ure in the pour-ing rain #
A thou-sand fa-ces all re-flect his pain # copy(verse,1)
He walks the streets a-gainst the ci-ty's hum # transpose(verse,1,2)
A ghost in the ma-chine where he's from # copy(verse,3)

PRECHORUS 1
The ne-on lights all blur in-to a haze #
Lost in the crowd for days and end-less days # copy(prechorus,1)

CHORUS 1
He's just a shad-ow in this i-ron maze #
A fleet-ing glimpse that no one ev-er stays # copy(chorus,1)
He's search-ing for a truth he can-not find # transpose(chorus,1,5)
Leav-ing on-ly ech-oes of his mind # copy(chorus,3)

VERSE 2
He sees the world through pane-less win-dow frames # 8,8,8,8 syllables
And whis-pers all the long-for-got-ten names
He's haunt-ed by the dreams he left be-hind
A fug-i-tive of a dif-fer-ent kind

PRECHORUS 2
The ne-on lights all blur in-to a haze # 8,8 syllables
Lost in the crowd for days and end-less days

CHORUS 2
He's just a shad-ow in this i-ron maze # 8,8,8,8 syllables
A fleet-ing glimpse that no one ev-er stays
He's search-ing for a truth he can-not find
Leav-ing on-ly ech-oes of his mind

BRIDGE 1
The pave-ment stretch-es out a mile too long #
A lone-ly road where he does not be-long # copy(bridge,1)
He'd trade it all to find a place to rest # transpose(bridge,1,-2)
To put his wea-ry spir-it to the test # copy(bridge,3)

CHORUS 3
He's just a shad-ow in this i-ron maze # 8,8,8,8 syllables
A fleet-ing glimpse that no one ev-er stays
He's search-ing for a truth he can-not find
Leav-ing on-ly ech-oes of his mind

SOLO
A lone-ly fig-ure in the pour-ing rain # copy(verse,1)
A thou-sand fa-ces all re-flect his pain # copy(verse,2)
He walks the streets a-gainst the ci-ty's hum # copy(verse,3)
A ghost in the ma-chine where he's from # copy(verse,4)

CHORUS 4
He's just a shad-ow in this i-ron maze # 8,8,8,8 syllables
A fleet-ing glimpse that no one ev-er stays
He's search-ing for a truth he can-not find
Leav-ing on-ly ech-oes of his mind
