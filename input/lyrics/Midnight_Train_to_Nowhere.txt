INTRO
Well the whis-tle blows at mid-night hour                    #
Through the hol-low streets of shame                         #
Where the neon signs are flick-er-ing                       #
And no-bo-dy knows your name                                #

VERSE
I been walk-ing down this lone-ly road                      #
With my gui-tar and my dreams                               #
Where the rail-road tracks meet hea-ven                     #
And no-thing's quite what it seems                          #
The preach-er man was count-ing mon-ey                      #
While the sin-ners knelt to pray                           #
And I asked my-self the ques-tion                          #
Lord, will there come a bet-ter day?                       #

PRECHORUS
'Cause the wind keeps blow-ing east-ward                    #
And the rain keeps fall-ing down                           #

CHORUS
Take me home on that mid-night train                       #
Where the lost souls go to hide                            #
From the trou-bles and the heart-ache                      #
That we car-ry deep in-side                                #
Oh the mid-night train keeps roll-ing                      #
Through the dark-ness of my mind                           #
Leave the past be-hind me                                  #
And some peace I hope to find                              #

VERSE
Now the cy-nics and the dream-ers                          # copy(verse,1)
They all gath-er 'round the fire                           # copy(verse,2)
Sing-ing songs of rev-o-lu-tion                            # copy(verse,3)
While their souls grow ev-er ti-red                        # copy(verse,4)
The rich man's gold won't save him                         # copy(verse,5)
When the judg-ment day ar-rives                            # copy(verse,6)
And the poor man's only trea-sure                          # copy(verse,7)
Is the love that keeps him a-live                          # copy(verse,8)

BRIDGE
Well the proph-ets spoke of free-dom                       #
But they chained us to the ground                          #
And the truth gets lost in whis-pers                       #
When there's no-bo-dy a-round                              #
So I'll keep on walk-ing for-ward                          #
Though the path is dark and long                           #
With my heart full of ques-tions                           #
And my soul full of song                                   #
