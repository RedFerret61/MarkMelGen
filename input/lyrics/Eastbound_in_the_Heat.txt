# Eastbound in the Heat

INTRO                                   
Wheels roll slow-ly down the line       # 7
Leav-ing all the clouds be-hind         # 	reverse(intro,1)
Sun climbs up and starts to shine       # 	copy(intro,1)
Gold-en rays like liq-uid wine         	# 	transpose(intro,2,-2)

VERSE 1
We drive East to chase the sun         	# 7
Run from storms and col-der run        	# 7
Win-ter winds have had their fun       	# 	copy(verse,1)
Now it's time for burn-ing tongues     	# 	reverse(verse,2)

PRECHORUS
Heat ris-es from the tar          		# 7
Sweat like a sin-ner's scar       		# 	transpose(prechorus,1,2)

CHORUS
Hot as an ov-en now       				# 6
Feel it on ev-'ry brow      			# 	copy(chorus,1)
Sun laughs at all be-low    			# 6
Turn up the ra-di-o        				# 	copy(chorus,3)

VERSE 2
Dust kicks up be-hind our tires      # 9
Rag-ing like some lost de-sires      # 9
Heat waves dance on roads un-tamed   # 9
Burn-ing bright in flam-ing frames   # 9

BRIDGE
The sun looks down on the peo-ple be-low            # 10,10,10,10
They are drip-pin' with sweat, mov-in' so slow      # 	transpose(bridge,1,-3)
Sur-pri-sing wea-ther greets me each morn-in'       # 
Gold light pours down, with no signs of war-nin'    # 	transpose(bridge,1,3)

VERSE 3
Moon-rise finds us by the sea       # 9
Breez-es hum through palm leaf trees    # 9
Warm night air holds me so tight     # 9
Flick-er-ing like camp-fire light    # 9
