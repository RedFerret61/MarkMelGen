INTRO  
La la la la la la la                                       #  
La la la la la la la                                       # copy(intro,1)  

VERSE 1  
Sum-mer nights be-neath the dis-co ball                   #  
Re-flec-tions danc-ing on the wall                        # copy(verse,1)  
Your eyes met mine a-cross the crowded floor              # transpose(verse,1,4)  
Like we'd al-ways known each oth-er be-fore               # copy(verse,3)  

PRECHORUS 1  
But time moves on like a roll-ing dice                    #  
Turn-ing sweet to bit-ter sac-ri-fice                     # copy(prechorus,1)  

CHORUS 1  
Oh, the game of love is play-ing us a-gain                #  
Win-ning hearts just to lose them in the rain             # copy(chorus,1)  
Spin-ning round in cir-cles of de-sire                    # transpose(chorus,1,-2)  
Burn-ing bright then fad-ing like a fire                  # copy(chorus,3)  

VERSE 2  
Phon-o-graph plays our fa-vor-ite sad song                # 8,8,8,8 syllables  
All the words that came out wrong  
Now the si-lence screams where laugh-ter flowed  
Car-ry-ing this heav-y load  

PRECHORUS 2  
But time moves on like a roll-ing dice                    # 7,8 syllables

CHORUS 2  
Oh, the game of love is play-ing us a-gain                # 8,8,8,8 syllables  
Win-ning hearts just to lose them in the rain  
Spin-ning round in cir-cles of de-sire  
Burn-ing bright then fad-ing like a fire  

BRIDGE 1  
Phot-o-graphs in mon-o-chrome                            #  
Show-ing places we called home                            # copy(bridge,1)  
Was it real or just a fan-ta-sy?                         # transpose(bridge,1,3)  
The an-swer's lost in mem-o-ry                           # copy(bridge,3)  

CHORUS 3  
Oh, the game of love is play-ing us a-gain                # 8,8,8,8 syllables  
Win-ning hearts just to lose them in the rain  
Spin-ning round in cir-cles of de-sire  
Burn-ing bright then fad-ing like a fire
