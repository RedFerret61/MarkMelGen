INTRO
Well hel-lo there, ba-by, ain't life grand #
With a trum-pet in my heart and love in my hand # transpose(intro,1,4)

VERSE
Down in New Or-leans where the jazz was born #
I learned to play my horn from dusk till dawn # invert(verse,1,Bb4)
The riv-er-boat was rock-ing to the beat #
While all the folks were tap-ping with their feet # reverse(verse,3)

Oh yeah, oh yeah, that's what I say #
Mu-sic makes ev-ery-thing o-kay # transpose(prechorus,1,-2)

CHORUS
What a won-der-ful world when you're by my side #
Like a brass band march-ing full of joy and pride # invert(chorus,1,F4)
Scat that mel-o-dy, ba-by, scat it loud #
Make this old heart hap-py and proud # reverse(chorus,3)
