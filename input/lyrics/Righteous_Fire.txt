INTRO
Zi-on call-ing, can you hear the sound                    #

VERSE 1
Bab-y-lon sys-tem try to bring us down                    #
But the right-eous fire burn through-out the town        # copy(verse,1)
Ras-ta man know the way to go                            # transpose(verse,1,3)
Plant the seed and watch the wis-dom grow               # copy(verse,3)

PRECHORUS 1
Jah will guide us through the storm                      #
Keep our spir-its safe and warm                          # copy(prechorus,1)

CHORUS 1
Rise up, rise up, chil-dren of the light                 #
Burn a-way the dark-ness with your might                 # copy(chorus,1)
One love, one heart, beat-ing as one                     # transpose(chorus,1,4)
Un-til Jah's work on earth is done                       # copy(chorus,3)
