# The Scar-f You Left / Ma-ple Street / That Sep-tem-ber Night

INTRO
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh #
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh # copy(intro,1)
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh # transpose(intro,1,2)

VERSE 1
I found that po-lar-oid from the state fair #
Your hair was a mess from the au-tumn air # copy(verse,1)
You were wear-ing my fa-vor-ite sweat-er # transpose(verse,1,5)
Back when we thought we'd last for-ev-er # copy(verse,3)

PRECHORUS 1
And I drive by that old cof-fee shop some-times #
Just to see if your car is still parked out-side # copy(prechorus,1)

CHORUS 1
And it's just an-oth-er Tues-day af-ter-noon #
But I'm still stuck in that Sep-tem-ber room # copy(chorus,1)
Sing-ing a-long to some for-got-ten tune # transpose(chorus,1,4)
Wish-ing that I could for-get a-bout you # copy(chorus,3)

VERSE 2
I still re-mem-ber the sound of your laugh # 9,8,9,8 syllables
And the way you'd trace my name on the glass
Now it's just a ghost, a pho-to-graph
Cut-ting my whole heart right in half

PRECHORUS 2
And I drive by that old cof-fee shop some-times # 10,10 syllables
Just to see if your car is still parked out-side

CHORUS 2
And it's just an-oth-er Tues-day af-ter-noon # 10,10,10,10 syllables
But I'm still stuck in that Sep-tem-ber room
Sing-ing a-long to some for-got-ten tune
Wish-ing that I could for-get a-bout you

BRIDGE 1
And may-be I'm the one who's stuck in place #
May-be I'm the one you can't re-place # copy(bridge,1)
And I see your face in ev-ery crowd I see # transpose(bridge,1,-3)
Does Ma-ple Street ev-er re-mind you of me # copy(bridge,3)

SOLO
I found that po-lar-oid from the state fair # copy(verse,1)
Your hair was a mess from the au-tumn air # copy(verse,2)
You were wear-ing my fa-vor-ite sweat-er # copy(verse,3)
Back when we thought we'd last for-ev-er # copy(verse,4)

CHORUS 3
And it's just an-oth-er Tues-day af-ter-noon # 10,10,10,10 syllables
But I'm still stuck in that Sep-tem-ber room
Sing-ing a-long to some for-got-ten tune
Wish-ing that I could for-get a-bout you

OUTRO
For-get a-bout you, oh-oh # copy(chorus,4)
For-get a-bout you # reverse(outro,1)
Yeah, I wish I could for-get a-bout you # transpose(outro,1,5)
But I can't for-get a-bout you # invert(outro,1,G4)
