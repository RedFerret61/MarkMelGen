verse 1
a dash-ing through the snow
our one-horse o-pen sleigh
o-ver the fields we go
we're laugh-ing all the way 
bells on a bob tail ring
were mak-ing spi-rits bright
what fun it is to ride and sing
a sleig-hing song to-night oh

chorus 1
jin-gle bells jin-gle bells
jin-gle all the way
oh what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse o-pen sleigh hey
jin-gle bells jin-gle bells
jin-gle all the way
oh what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse o-pen sleigh

verse 2
a day or two a-go
i thought i'd take a ride
and soon miss fan-ny bright
was sea-ted by my side
the horse was lean and lank
mis-for-tune seemed his lot
he got in-to a drif-ted bank
and then we got up-set aah

oh what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse o-pen sleigh

verse 3
a day or two a-go
the sto-ry i must tell
i went out on the snow
and on my back i fell
a gent was ri-ding by
a one-horse o-pen sleigh
he laughed as there i spraw-ling lie
but quick-ly drove a-way ah

and now the ground is white
go it while you are young
to take the girls to-night
and sing this sleig-hing song
just get a bob-tailed bay
two for-ty as his speed
then hitch him to an o-pen sleigh
and crack you will take the lead
