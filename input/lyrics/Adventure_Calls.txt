INTRO
Through the mead-ows green and wide                    #
Where the morn-ing sun-light shines                    # copy(intro,1)
A he-ro's tale be-gins to-day                          #

VERSE
In a vil-lage small and peace-ful                     #

Wait-ing for his chance to grow                       # copy(verse,2)
With a sword up-on his shoul-der                      #
And a heart both brave and true                       #

PRECHORUS
Now the wind is call-ing soft-ly                      #
Through the an-cient oak trees tall                   #
Ad-ven-ture waits be-yond the ho-ri-zon               #

CHORUS
Rise up, rise up, brave war-ri-or                     #
The world needs you to-day                            #

With cour-age burn-ing in your heart                  #
And wis-dom as your guide                             #
The leg-end starts with one small step                #
With friends stand-ing by your side                   # copy(chorus,6)
