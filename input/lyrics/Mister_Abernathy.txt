Da da da da, da da da da                                                                                                   #
Da da da da, da da da da                                                                                                   # copy(intro,1)

VERSE 1
Mis-ter Ab-er-na-thy wakes at dawn                                                              #
Puts his worn out pair of well-ies on                                                           #
Steps out on the damp and dew-y lawn                                                            # transpose(verse,1,2)
'Til the morn-ing light is near-ly gone                                                         # copy(verse,3)

PRECHORUS 1
And the pa-per boy on his rust-y bike                                                           #
Does-n't look at all like some-one you would like                                               # copy(prechorus,1)

CHORUS 1
Oh, the world keeps turn-ing round and round                                             #
But he keeps his knees down on the ground                                                #
Find-ing peace in things he's new-ly found                                               # transpose(chorus,1,-3)
With-out e-ver mak-ing an-y sound                                                        # copy(chorus,3)

VERSE 2
La-dy Pim-ble from house num-ber two                                                            # 8,8,8,8 syllables
Peeks out through her win-dow pane of blue
She thinks he is lone-ly, it is true
But he's got a job he has to do

PRECHORUS 2
And the milk-man hums a hap-py tune                                                                 # 8,11 syllables
He could stare at all his flow-ers 'til the af-ter-noon

CHORUS 2
Oh, the world keeps turn-ing round and round                                      # 8,8,8,8 syllables
But he keeps his knees down on the ground
Find-ing peace in things he's new-ly found
With-out e-ver mak-ing an-y sound

BRIDGE 1
And it does-n't seem to mat-ter much at all                                           #
If the rain be-gins to fall                                                           #
He's got a wall to keep the frost out                                                 # transpose(bridge,1,-5)
Some-thing he can't be with-out                                                       # copy(bridge,3)
