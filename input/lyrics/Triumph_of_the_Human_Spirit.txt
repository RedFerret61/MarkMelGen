INTRO
From the depths of dark-est night we rise #
Like thun-der crash-ing through the storm-y skies # transpose(intro,1,5)

Though the moun-tains trem-ble at our feet #

We shall not yield to des-ti-ny's cruel hand #
But forge our fate through cour-age bold and grand # reverse(verse,3)

Let all the world your pow-er feel # invert(chorus,1,F4)
Through suf-fer-ing we find our strength #
We'll go to an-y glo-rious length # reverse(chorus,3)
