VERSE 1
Moon-light paints the Har-lem street in blue    #
Whis-pered prom-is-es 'tween me and you         # invert(verse,1,C4)
Sax-o-phone cries through a smok-y haze         # transpose(verse,1,4)
Spin-ning dreams from our yes-ter-day's         # copy(verse,3)

Oh this cit-y's rhy-thm gets un-der your skin   #
Steals your heart with its jun-gle grin          # reverse(prechorus,1)

CHORUS 1
Mid-night train to Mem-phis rolls a-long         #
Sing-in' soft that same old song                # copy(chorus,1)
Car-ry-in' my wea-ry soul                      # transpose(chorus,1,-5)

For the lov-ers lost last night

When the clar-i-net stops its cry-in'          #
