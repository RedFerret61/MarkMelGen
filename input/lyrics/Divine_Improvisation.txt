INTRO
Om mani pad-me hum                                         #
Om mani pad-me hum                                         # copy(intro,1)

VERSE 1
In the si-lence be-fore the first note sounds            #
Where the spir-it and mu-sic be-come un-bound            # copy(verse,1)
Ev-ery breath is a prayer to the sky                     # transpose(verse,1,4)
Ev-ery tone lifts the soul up high                       # copy(verse,3)

PRECHORUS 1
Search-ing for that per-fect phrase                      #
Through the mys-tic jazz-y maze                          # copy(prechorus,1)

CHORUS 1
Play it from the heart and soul                          #
Let the mu-sic make you whole                            # copy(chorus,1)
Sheet-s of sound cas-cade like rain                      # transpose(chorus,1,5)
Wash-ing a-way all the pain                              # copy(chorus,3)

VERSE 2
Scales as-cend-ing like in-cense smoke                   # 7,8,7,6 syllables
Har-mo-nies that heal what once was broke
Chan-ting through the horn of gold
Sto-ries that must be told

PRECHORUS 2
Search-ing for that per-fect phrase                      # 7,7 syllables
Through the mys-tic jazz-y maze

CHORUS 2
Play it from the heart and soul                          # 7,7,8,7 syllables
Let the mu-sic make you whole
Sheet-s of sound cas-cade like rain
Wash-ing a-way all the pain

BRIDGE 1
When the world grows cold and dark                       #
Mu-sic lights the sa-cred spark                          # copy(bridge,1)
God speaks through the ten-or's cry                      # transpose(bridge,1,-3)
Truth that nev-er tells a lie                            # copy(bridge,3)

CHORUS 3
Play it from the heart and soul                          # 7,7,8,7 syllables
Let the mu-sic make you whole
Sheet-s of sound cas-cade like rain
Wash-ing a-way all the pain
