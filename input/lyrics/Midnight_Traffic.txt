VERSE 1
Down on Ven-tu-ra where the neon bleeds                   #
An-oth-er play-er with his se-cret needs                  # copy(verse,1)
She's count-ing mon-ey in a ho-tel room                   # transpose(verse,1,2)
While the juke-box plays that lone-ly tune                # copy(verse,3)

PRECHORUS 1
Tell me ba-by what's your game                            #
Noth-ing here will be the same                            # copy(prechorus,1)

CHORUS 1
Mid-night traf-fic on the free-way                        #
Driv-ing fast but go-ing no-where                         # copy(chorus,1)
All the an-gels lost their wing-span                      # transpose(chorus,1,4)
In this Cal-i-for-nia night-mare                          # copy(chorus,3)

VERSE 2
Sev-en-ty-three was such a gold-en year                   # 8,8,8,7 syllables
Now the mir-rors show what we most fear
Coc-tails served with ex-is-ten-tial dread
While the ghosts of jazz musi-cians play-ing in your head

PRECHORUS 2  
Tell me ba-by what's your game                            # 7,7 syllables

In this Cal-i-for-nia night-mare

BRIDGE 1
Ste-reo-phon-ic blues and char-don-nay                    #
Pret-ty wom-en danc-ing slow-ly fade a-way                # copy(bridge,1)
In the cor-ner booth a stran-ger counts his chips         # transpose(bridge,1,-3)
While the wait-ress dreams of oth-er trips                # copy(bridge,3)
