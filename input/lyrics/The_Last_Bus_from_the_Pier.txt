(Jang-ling gui-tar riff) # copy(intro,1)

VERSE 1
The sta-tion ca-fe clock reads four #
I've seen this ve-ry scene be-fore # copy(verse,1)
A rain-streaked pane, a tat-tered book # transpose(verse,1,3)
You nev-er spare a sin-gle look # copy(verse,3)

PRECHORUS 1
And the tea in this cup is grim and cold #
A sto-ry that is best left un-told # copy(prechorus,1)

CHORUS 1
And oh, this town's a great mis-take #
A heart that heav-en could not break # copy(chorus,1)
Would shat-ter with a sin-gle word # transpose(chorus,1,5)
The sweet-est sound I've ev-er heard # copy(chorus,3)

VERSE 2
The girl be-hind the coun-ter sighs # 8,8,8,8 syllables
With hope-less-ness deep in her eyes
She knows my or-der, knows my name
To-mor-row it will be the same

PRECHORUS 2
And the tea in this cup is grim and cold # 8,8 syllables
A sto-ry that is best left un-told

CHORUS 2
And oh, this town's a great mis-take # 8,8,8,8 syllables
A heart that heav-en could not break
Would shat-ter with a sin-gle word
The sweet-est sound I've ev-er heard

BRIDGE 1
Must I ride the late bus home a-gain? #
A-lone with the cold and the driv-ing rain # copy(bridge,1)
Some peo-ple have got so much love to give # transpose(bridge,1,-3)
But I've bare-ly got the will to live # copy(bridge,3)

SOLO
The sta-tion ca-fe clock reads four # copy(verse,1)
I've seen this ve-ry scene be-fore # copy(verse,2)
A rain-streaked pane, a tat-tered book # copy(verse,3)
You nev-er spare a sin-gle look # copy(verse,4)

CHORUS 3
And oh, this town's a great mis-take # 8,8,8,8 syllables
A heart that heav-en could not break
Would shat-ter with a sin-gle word
The sweet-est sound I've ev-er heard

OUTRO
The sweet-est sound I've ev-er heard #
The sweet-est sound I've ev-er heard # copy(outro,1)
Oh, this crush-ing, crush-ing town # transpose(outro,1,-5)
Oh, this town... # invert(outro,3,G4)
