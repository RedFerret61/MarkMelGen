Just A Room With A View / Where Do The Summers Go? / Another Monday In Lyndhurst
INTRO
An-oth-er Mon-day #
In this small Eng-lish town #
The clock strikes three #
And rain comes down # copy(intro,2)

VERSE 1
The shop-fronts gleam #
A wet-slate grey #
And peo-ple hur-ry # 8 syllables
On their way # 6 syllables
They don't see me # copy(verse,1)
Be-hind the glass # 5 syllables
Just watch-ing mo-ments # copy(verse,3)
As they pass # 4 syllables

PRECHORUS 1
And oh #
The tel-e-phone #
For-gets my name #
And I sup-pose # invert(prechorus,2,C4)
That you're the one to blame # 8 syllables

CHORUS 1
Some-one should tell the clouds #
That yes-ter-day was clear #
And some-one should tell my heart # transpose(chorus,1,-2)
That you are still not here # 7 syllables
It's just a room with a view # copy(chorus,2)
Of tears and af-ter-noon # 7 syllables

VERSE 2
I read the news #
From page to page #
A world keeps turn-ing # transpose(verse,1,+3)
On a stage # 3 syllables
But my small world # copy(verse,2)
Is stand-ing still # 5 syllables
And I pre-tend # transpose(verse,3,-4)
It al-ways will # 5 syllables

PRECHORUS 2
And so # # 8,7,8,6 syllables
I pour the tea # copy(prechorus,2)
I wait in vain # copy(prechorus,3)
I think I see # invert(prechorus,4,C4)
Your face a-gainst the pane # copy(prechorus,5)

CHORUS 2
Some-one should tell the clouds # # 8,7,8,7 syllables
That yes-ter-day was clear # copy(chorus,2)
And some-one should tell my heart # transpose(chorus,1,-2)
That you are still not here # copy(chorus,4)
It's just a room with a view # copy(chorus,5)
Of tears and af-ter-noon # copy(chorus,6)

BRIDGE
May-be to-mor-row the sun will break through #
And I'll walk out that door #
With-out a thought of you # 7 syllables
But who am I try-ing to fool? # copy(bridge,2)

SOLO
Some-one should tell the clouds # copy(chorus,1)
That yes-ter-day was clear # copy(chorus,2)
And some-one should tell my heart # copy(chorus,3)
That you are still not here # copy(chorus,4)
It's just a room with a view # copy(chorus,5)
Of tears and af-ter-noon # copy(chorus,6)

CHORUS 3
Some-one should tell the clouds # # 8,7,8,7 syllables
That yes-ter-day was clear # copy(chorus,2)
And some-one should tell my heart # transpose(chorus,1,-2)
That you are still not here # copy(chorus,4)
It's just a room with a view # copy(chorus,5)
Of tears and af-ter-noon # copy(chorus,6)

OUTRO
An-oth-er Mon-day # copy(intro,1)
Just rain fall-ing down # reverse(intro,2)
Just rain # 2 syllables
Fall-ing down # 3 syllables
