verse 1
i like you and you love me too
be-tter that you love me less
be-tter you hate me more
love me or hate me babe

prechorus
this love of which i write
am I a-lone in fee-ling

chorus
those whom the la-zy souls love
laying on the gal-lows
i know this love will pre-vail
i know this love will pre-vail

verse 2
I am a-blaze un-der your love
let me burn a lit-tle while
oh you make me jeal-ous
you fool me you love me

prechorus
the day i said good-bye
the pain i love dis-ap-pears

chorus
those whom the la-zy souls love
laying on the gal-lows
i know this love will pre-vail
i know this love will pre-vail

bridge
all that i love has to die
for some-thing to live for

chorus
those whom the la-zy souls love
laying on the gal-lows
i know this love will pre-vail
i know this love will pre-vail
