verse 1

what so proud-ly we haild at the twi-lights last glea-ming
whose broad stripes and bright stars through the per-il-ous fight
oer the ram-parts we watchd were so gal-lant-ly stream-ing
and the rock-ets red glare the bombs burst-ing in air
gave proof through the night that our flag was still there
o say does that star-span-gled ban-ner yet wave
oer the land of the free and the home of the brave
