VERSE 1
o say can you see by the dawns ear-ly light                         # 11 syllables
what so proud-ly we haild at the twi-lights last glea-ming          # 13 syllables
whose broad stripes and bright stars through the per-il-ous fight   #   copy(verse,1)
oer the ram-parts we watchd were so gal-lant-ly stream-ing          #   copy(verse,2)

PRECHORUS 1
and the rock-ets red glare the bombs burst-ing in air               # 12 syllables
gave proof through the night that our flag was still there          # 11 syllables

CHORUS 1
o say does that star-span-gled ban-ner yet wave                     # 12 syllables
oer the land of the free and the home of the brave                  # 12 syllables
