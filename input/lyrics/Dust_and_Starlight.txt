VERSE 1
The sky here burns a dif-fer-ent blue, 		# 9,4,9,4 syllables
No earth-ly hue. 							# 4 syllables
The stars do not twin-kle, they just stare, # 	copy(verse,1)
So cold and bare. 							# 	copy(verse,2)

PRECHORUS
I miss the rain, 							# 4,4,4,4 syllables
Your laugh-ter's tune, 						# 	transpose(prechorus,1,-2)
This crat-er's womb 						# 	transpose(prechorus,1,-3)
Feels like a tomb. 							# 	transpose(prechorus,1,-4)

CHORUS
Oh, love, are you lis-ten-ing? 				# 7,3,3,3 syllables
I'm just dust, 								# 3 syllables
I still trust 							    # 	transpose(chorus,2, 5)
You're my light. 							# 	copy(chorus,2)

VERSE 2
I plant-ed some seeds from home last spring, 	# 9,4,9,4  syllables
They won't take wing. 						    #
The ground's too salt-y, the air's too thin, 	#
Noth-ing is in. 								#

PRECHORUS
Ra-di-o's dead, 							# 4,4,4,4 syllables
No sig-nal left, 							#
Just ghosts and steps, 						# 
And my last breath. 						#

CHORUS
Oh, love, are you lis-ten-ing? 				# 7,3,3,3 syllables
I'm just dust, 								#
I still trust 							    #
You're my light. 							#

BRIDGE
Some-day they'll find this bro-ken ship and read my scrawled good-bye, 		# 14 syllables
But to-night, I'll dream you're ly-ing be-side me in the sky.  		        #   copy(bridge, 1)

VERSE 3
The sun-set, it lasts for for-ty days, 		# 9,4,9,4 syllables
A crim-son blaze. 							#
I name the bright peaks for you my dear 	#
Though you're not here. 					#

PRECHORUS
Time is a trick, 							# 4,4,4,4 syllables
The clocks all failed, 						#
My heart's de-railed, 						#
But love's not frail. 						#

CHORUS
Oh, love, are you lis-ten-ing? 				# 7,3,3,3 syllables
I'm just dust, 								#
I still trust 							    #
You're my light. 							#

Oh, love, are you lis-ten-ing? 				# 7,3,3,3 syllables
I'm just dust, 								#
I still trust 							    #
You're my light. 							#
