# Rag-time Sweet-heart / Dan-cing Down Main Street / The Syn-co-pat-ed Blues
INTRO
Down in Se-da-lia where the rag-time plays #
Ev-ery-bod-y's danc-ing through their hap-py days # transpose(intro,1,3)

VERSE
I got a gal who loves to syn-co-pate #
She moves her feet in time, she's nev-er late # invert(verse,1,C4)
When the pia-no man starts play-ing that sweet song #
She grabs my hand and pulls me right a-long # reverse(verse,3)

PRECHORUS
Come on, hon-ey, let's do the cake-walk dance #
Give your lov-ing man just one more chance # transpose(prechorus,1,-2)

CHORUS
Rag-time sweet-heart, won't you be mine #
Step to the left, then step in line # invert(chorus,1,F4)
When the mu-sic starts to bounce and swing #
You make my fool-ish heart want to sing # reverse(chorus,3)
