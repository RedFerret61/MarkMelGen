INTRO
Go-ing down, down, down, down, down #
Go-ing down, down, down, down, down # copy(intro,1)

VERSE 1
News-pa-per tax-i is wait-ing for me #
He's made out of yes-ter-day's mis-er-y # copy(verse,1)
A pen-guin wait-er is pour-ing the sea # transpose(verse,1,3)
Says 'have a nice day, sir, the o-cean is free' # copy(verse,2)

PRECHORUS 1
And I look in the mir-ror to see #
But the mir-ror is look-ing at me # copy(prechorus,1)

CHORUS 1
I know you know me but I don't know who's there #
Stand-ing on sun-shine and breath-ing the air # copy(chorus,1)
They're sell-ing tick-ets to go no-where fast # transpose(chorus,1,5)
The fu-ture is o-ver, it's all in the past # copy(chorus,3)

VERSE 2
A tel-e-phone priest rings a crack in the sky # 10,9,10,11 syllables
He's got all the ans-wers but does-n't know why
The queen of the sub-way is wear-ing my hair
She smiles at the peo-ple who are-n't real-ly there

PRECHORUS 2
And I look in the mir-ror to see # 7,7 syllables
But the mir-ror is look-ing at me

CHORUS 2
I know you know me but I don't know who's there # 11,10,11,11 syllables
Stand-ing on sun-shine and breath-ing the air
They're sell-ing tick-ets to go no-where fast
The fu-ture is o-ver, it's all in the past

BRIDGE 1
Tell me the truth, if the truth is a game #
Is win-ning and los-ing ex-act-ly the same? # copy(bridge,1)
I'm climb-ing the lad-der but the lad-der is gone # transpose(bridge,1,-2)
And I have to keep sing-ing this ver-y same song # copy(bridge,2)

CHORUS 3
I know you know me but I don't know who's there # 11,10,11,11 syllables

The fu-ture is o-ver, it's all in the past
