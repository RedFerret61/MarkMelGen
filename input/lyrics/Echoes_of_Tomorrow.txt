# Echoes of Tomorrow / When Stars Collide / The Edge of Infinity

INTRO
In the si-lence be-fore the storm                        #
When the world holds its breath and waits               # copy(intro,1)

VERSE 1
Through the shad-ows of what we've known                #
Walk-ing paths that lead us home                        # copy(verse,1)
Ev-ery foot-step writes our name                        # transpose(verse,1,+3)6gyft
In the dust of yes-ter-day                             # copy(verse,2)
But to-mor-row calls us forth                           # invert(verse,1,D4)
To the light be-yond the north                          # copy(verse,4)

CHORUS 1
We are the ech-oes of to-mor-row                        #
Ris-ing from the ash-es of our sor-row                  # copy(chorus,1)
When the stars col-lide a-bove us                       # transpose(chorus,1,+5)
We will find the strength to love us                    # copy(chorus,2)
At the edge of in-fin-i-ty                             # transpose(chorus,3,-2)
We dis-cov-er who we're meant to be                     # copy(chorus,4)

VERSE 2
In the fire of break-ing chains                         # 7,6,7,6,7,7 syllables
Feel the thun-der in our veins                          # copy(verse,1)
Ev-ery scar be-comes a crown                            # transpose(verse,1,+3)
Lift-ing spir-its from the ground                       # copy(verse,2)
Through the dark-ness we will soar                      # invert(verse,1,D4)
To the light worth fight-ing for                        # copy(verse,4)

CHORUS 2
We are the ech-oes of to-mor-row                        # 9,10,7,8,7,10 syllables
Ris-ing from the ash-es of our sor-row                  # copy(chorus,1)
When the stars col-lide a-bove us                       # transpose(chorus,1,+5)
We will find the strength to love us                    # copy(chorus,2)
At the edge of in-fin-i-ty                             # transpose(chorus,3,-2)
We dis-cov-er who we're meant to be                     # copy(chorus,4)

BRIDGE
Time un-folds like gold-en wings                        #
Car-ry-ing our whis-pered dreams                        # copy(bridge,1)
Through the void where hope takes flight                # transpose(bridge,1,+4)
Turn-ing dark-ness in-to light                          # copy(bridge,2)

CHORUS 3
We are the ech-oes of to-mor-row                        # 9,10,7,8,7,10 syllables

When the stars col-lide a-bove us                       # transpose(chorus,1,+5)
We will find the strength to love us                    # copy(chorus,2)
At the edge of in-fin-i-ty                             # transpose(chorus,3,-2)

OUTRO
In the si-lence af-ter the storm                        # transpose(intro,1,+3)
When the world ex-hales and dreams                      # copy(intro,1)
