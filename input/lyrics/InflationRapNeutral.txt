verse 1
i knew you when you were twice the in-fla-tion
i knew you when you were twice the in-fla-tion
and you still turn the lights off
you know the sit-u-a-tion is se-ri-ous

prechorus
i am a rock of a dif-fer-ent in-fla-tion
i rock on the wind

chorus
just my kind of mor-ning
the in-fla-tion of a smile
i am a wo-man she is a man
come down in in-fla-tion, come in-side my gym kar-ma

verse 2

i made a plan-et the in-fla-tion of mars
and then i saw it for the first time
the goal is to have a good day
some-times it helps you see the world with a dif-fer-ent in-fla-tion

prechorus
i thought a-bout Christ and i grew qui-et in my bed
in fact it was like i had grown a new in-fla-tion

chorus
just my kind of mor-ning
the in-fla-tion of a smile
i am a wo-man she is a man
come down in in-fla-tion, come in-side my gym kar-ma

bridge
he had all the an-swers
could make the pain go a-way

chorus
just my kind of mor-ning
the in-fla-tion of a smile
i am a wo-man she is a man
come down in in-fla-tion, come in-side my gym kar-ma
