# Black Cat Woman
INTRO
She came roll-ing in-to town like thun-der #
Left me torn a-part and full of won-der # copy(intro,1)

VERSE
Black cat wom-an with her wick-ed smile #
Stayed with me, ba-by, just a lit-tle while # copy(verse,1)
Wore her leath-er tight and her hair so long #
Had me dan-cing to her si-ren song # copy(verse,3)

PRECHORUS
Now she's gone a-way #
Left me here to pay # copy(prechorus,1)

CHORUS
She's a dev-il's daugh-ter, fire and flame #
Play-ing her temp-ta-tion game # copy(chorus,1)
Got her hooks in-to my desperate heart #
Tore my world com-plete-ly a-part # copy(chorus,3)

Cig-a-rette smoke curl-ing 'round her face # 8 syllables
Lost my soul in that for-bid-den place # copy(verse,2)
Whis-pered prom-is-es she nev-er meant # 8 syllables
All my mon-ey and my time was spent # copy(verse,4)

Some-times love feels like a load-ed gun #
