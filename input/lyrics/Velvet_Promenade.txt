The ci-ty sighs a sap-phire tune #
Be-neath a la-zy, hang-ing moon # transpose(intro,1,-5)

VERSE 1
We stroll a-long the av-e-nue #
The street-lights cast a gold-en hue #
Each foot-step marks a soft re-frain # copy(verse,1)
A sweet per-cus-sion in the rain # invert(verse,2,A4)

CHORUS 1
This vel-vet prom-e-nade with you #
Paints ev-ery shad-ow some-thing new #
A sym-pho-ny the night-time plays # transpose(chorus,1,+5)
Lost in the glo-ry of these days # copy(chorus,2)

VERSE 2
The sax-o-phone be-gins to weep #
While all the rest-less bou-le-vards sleep # transpose(verse,2,-3)
Your laugh-ter cuts the ha-zy air # copy(verse,3)
A jew-el bright be-yond com-pare # reverse(verse,4)

CHORUS 2
This vel-vet prom-e-nade with you # 8,9,8,7 syllables
Paints ev-ery shad-ow some-thing new # copy(chorus,2)
A sym-pho-ny the night-time plays # copy(chorus,3)
Lost in the glo-ry of these days # copy(chorus,4)

BRIDGE
Some folks chase dreams that fade too fast #
They build a world that can-not last # transpose(bridge,1,+2)
But this sweet mo-ment, soft and low #
Is all the par-a-dise I'll know # invert(bridge,2,C5)
