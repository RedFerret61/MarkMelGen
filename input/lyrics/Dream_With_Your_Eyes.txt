INTRO
Oh-oh yeah yeah yeah                                    #
Mmm-mm la la la                                         # copy(intro,1)

VERSE 1
Walk-ing down the bro-ken lane                          #
Think-ing 'bout that time a-gain                        # copy(verse,1)
Sky is grey, the clouds roll in                         # transpose(verse,1,2)
Like your voice be-neath my skin                        # copy(verse,3)

PRECHORUS 1
I can still hear what you said                          #
Echoes ring in-side my head                             # copy(prechorus,1)

CHORUS 1
All my dreams have blown a-way                          #
Like the words we used to say                           # copy(chorus,1)
Love was some-thing we could hold                       # transpose(chorus,1,4)
Now it's drift-ing, dark and cold                       # copy(chorus,3)

VERSE 2
Shad-ows fall on yes-ter-day                            # 7,7,7,7 syllables
Ev-ry laugh has slipped a-way
Leaves are danc-ing where we lay
Will you come back home some-day?

PRECHORUS 2
I can still hear what you said                          # 7,7 syllables
Echoes ring in-side my head

CHORUS 2
All my dreams have blown a-way                          # 8,7,8,7 syllables
Like the words we used to say
Love was some-thing we could hold
Now it's drift-ing, dark and cold

BRIDGE 1
You were there, then you were gone                      #
Just like morn-ing turns to dawn                        # copy(bridge,1)
I was lost be-fore the fall                             # transpose(bridge,1,-3)
Still I hear your si-lent call                          # copy(bridge,3)

CHORUS 3
All my dreams have blown a-way                          # 8,7,8,7 syllables
Like the words we used to say
Love was some-thing we could hold
Now it's drift-ing, dark and cold
