VERSE 1
I set my feet up-on the road,				# 8 syllables
Not know-ing where it bends.				# 6 syllables
The whis-pers call from days un-known,		#   copy(verse,1)
Where si-lence nev-er ends.					#   copy(verse,2)

VERSE 2
The past be-hind, a dis-tant haze,			# 8 syllables
Its echoes pull me back again.				# 6 syllables
I chase the dawn through end-less ways,		#   copy(verse,1)
And walk the sun-lit track.					#   copy(verse,2)

CHORUS 1
Through sha-dows, in-to light,				# 6 syllables
I chase the day, I leave the night.			# 8 syllables
Eve-ry step, a tale un-told,				# 7 syllables
A wea-ry heart, a hand to hold.				#   copy(chorus,2)

SOLO                                        # invert more recognisable than reverse, and reverse more recognisable than reverse invert
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 
1 2 3 4 5 6 7               		        #   invert(solo, 1, G4)

VERSE 3
The ri-ver knows the path it takes,			# 8 syllables
Yet ne-ver stays the same.					# 6 syllables
I wan-der too, through my mis-takes,		#   copy(verse,1)
Yet still, I know my name.					#   copy(verse,2)

BRIDGE 1
The stars will fade, the sky will turn,		# 8 syllables
The dark will lose its hold.				# 6 syllables
And though the night still bids me learn,	#   copy(bridge,1)
I'll walk the road I chose.					#   copy(bridge,2)

CHORUS 2
Through sha-dows, in-to light,				# 6 syllables
I chase the day, I leave the night.			# 8 syllables
Eve-ry step, a tale un-told,				# 7 syllables
No lon-ger lost, but mov-ing bold.			#   copy(chorus,2)
