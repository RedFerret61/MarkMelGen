INTRO
La la la la la la la                                       #
La la la la la la la                                       # copy(intro,1)

VERSE 1
In the soft morn-ing light I stare                         #
At the emp-ty chair, you're not there                      # copy(verse,1)
Won-der-ing if you'll ev-er come                           # transpose(verse,1,-2)
Or if I'm al-ways left a-lone                              # copy(verse,3)

PRECHORUS 1
And the world spins round and round                         #
With-out a care, in the air                                # copy(prechorus,1)

CHORUS 1
All I want is peace of mind                                #
All I need's a sign you're there                           # copy(chorus,1)
Give me strength to car-ry on                              # 
When hope is gone, I'm a-fraid                             # copy(chorus,3)

VERSE 2
Yel-low sub-ma-rine dreams a-way                           # 8,8,8,8 syllables
In the blue be-tween night and day
New-york ci-ty's cry-ing loud
Through the e-cho-ing crowd

PRECHORUS 2
And the world spins round and round                         # 7,7 syllables
With-out a care, in the air

CHORUS 2
All I want is peace of mind                                # 7,7,7,7 syllables
All I need's a sign you're there
Give me strength to car-ry on
When hope is gone, I'm a-fraid

BRIDGE 1
Some-times I feel like a bro-ken man                       #
Walk-ing through the pour-ing rain                         # copy(bridge,1)
Search-ing for the truth in-side                           # transpose(bridge,1,-3)
Where my hid-den fears re-side                             # copy(bridge,3)

SOLO
In the soft morn-ing light I stare                         # copy(verse,1)
At the emp-ty chair, you're not there                      # copy(verse,2)
Won-der-ing if you'll ev-er come                           # copy(verse,3)
Or if I'm al-ways left a-lone                              # copy(verse,4)

CHORUS 3
All I want is peace of mind                                # 7,7,7,7 syllables
All I need's a sign you're there
Give me strength to car-ry on
When hope is gone, I'm a-fraid
