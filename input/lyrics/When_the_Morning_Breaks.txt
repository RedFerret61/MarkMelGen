INTRO
In the qui-et of the night                              #
When the world has gone to sleep                        #

VERSE 1
I sit be-side this emp-ty win-dow                       #
Watch-ing shad-ows dance and sway                       #
All the mem-o-ries come flood-ing                       # copy(intro,1)
Of the words we could-n't say                           # transpose(intro,2,-2)

CHORUS 1  
But I'm still here wait-ing for the light               #
To break through all this end-less night                #
Though you're gone I feel you in my heart               # transpose(verse,1,+5)
We were meant for more than fall-ing a-part             # invert(verse,2,D4)

VERSE 2
Used to laugh un-til we cried                           # 7 syllables
Now I cry un-til I'm numb                               # copy(verse,2)
All the prom-is-es we whis-pered                        # transpose(verse,3,+3)
Now they're songs that can't be sung                    # invert(verse,4,C4)

CHORUS 2
But I'm still here wait-ing for the light               # 9,8,9,10 syllables
To break through all this end-less night                # copy(chorus,2)
Though you're gone I feel you in my heart               # copy(chorus,3)  
We were meant for more than fall-ing a-part             # copy(chorus,4)

BRIDGE
May-be time will heal these bro-ken dreams              #
May-be love ain't al-ways what it seems                 # transpose(bridge,1,-1)
But I'll hold on to what we used to be                  # copy(verse,1)
'Til the morn-ing sets my spir-it free                  # invert(chorus,2,F4)

SOLO
In the qui-et of the night                              # copy(intro,1)
When the world has gone to sleep                       # copy(intro,2)

CHORUS 3
But I'm still here wait-ing for the light               # 9,8,9,10 syllables
To break through all this end-less night                # copy(chorus,2)
Though you're gone I feel you in my heart               # copy(chorus,3)
We were meant for more than fall-ing a-part             # copy(chorus,4)

OUTRO
In the qui-et of the night                              # copy(intro,1)
I'll keep wait-ing for the light                        # transpose(chorus,1,+2)
