have a lit-tle faith in the an-ger
like some-thing nev-er hap-pe-ned
then you must re-lease it
re-lease your in-ner an-ger no no

prechorus 1
in-stead of cry-ing to-day
let it dry at-tack it like love

an-ger ba-by what i got on my-self
look at my look at my face
an-ger ba-by what i got on my-self
the let-ter from the de-mon

verse 2
my vi-sion is cloud-ed
by the tears and the an-ger
i swore once i was pur-pose and rea-son
now i mouth words full of an-ger

for the an-ger to melt a-way
and the bi-tter me-mo-ries to fade

chorus 2
an-ger ba-by what i got on my-self
look at my look at my face
an-ger ba-by what i got on my-self
the let-ter from the de-mon

if i can hurt some-bod-y then i can hurt me

chorus 3
an-ger ba-by what i got on my-self
look at my look at my face
an-ger ba-by what i got on my-self
