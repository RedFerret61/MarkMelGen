VERSE 1
There's a pi-an-o play-ing down on Main Street           #
Where the neon lights dance to the beat                   # copy(verse,1)
I've been search-ing for some-thing real                  # transpose(verse,1,4)
In this world that's lost the way to feel                 # copy(verse,3)

PRECHORUS 1
Take me back to sim-pler days                             #
When love could set our hearts a-blaze                    # copy(prechorus,1)

CHORUS 1
I'm a dream-er in the night                               #
Hold-ing on-to fad-ing light                              # copy(chorus,1)
Come and take me far from here                            # transpose(chorus,1,3)
Wash a-way my lone-ly tears                               # copy(chorus,3)

VERSE 2
Sat-ur-day night and I'm dress-ing up fine               # 9,8,7,8 syllables
Like a can-dle burn-ing bright in time
Mu-sic play-ing on the ra-di-o
Sing-ing songs from long a-go

BRIDGE 1
Trav-el-ing down this emp-ty high-way                    #
Look-ing for a bet-ter day                               # copy(bridge,1)
All these mem-o-ries fade a-way                          # transpose(bridge,1,-4)

Come and take me far from here
Wash a-way my lone-ly tears
