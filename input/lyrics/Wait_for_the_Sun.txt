All the flow-ers know your name                          # transpose(verse,1,5)
Ev-ery step just feels the same                          # copy(verse,3)

Hearts will turn like wheels of gold                     # transpose(chorus,1,4)
Love is some-thing you can't hold                        # copy(chorus,3)

VERSE 2
Let-ters left on win-dow-sills                          # 8,8,8,7 syllables

Moon-light danc-es on the ground
Still I hope you're com-ing 'round

I hear your voice in the morn-ing breeze                 #
Com-ing through the qui-et trees                         # copy(bridge,1)
Ev-ery day a new be-gin-ning song                        # transpose(bridge,1,2)
Sing-ing that we both be-long                            # copy(bridge,3)
