# A Frag-ile Truth / The Bell at Sea / Leaves on Stone

INTRO
Ohhh-ohhh the bell at sea                                  #
Rings through time and mem-o-ry                            # copy(intro,1)

VERSE 1
Down in the court-yard, an old man stands                  #
Hold-ing a scroll with trem-bling hands                   # copy(verse,1)
He reads of wars that nev-er end                          # transpose(verse,1,2)
And sighs for friends he used to send                     # copy(verse,3)

PRECHORUS 1
One voice lost a-mong the choir                           #
Can-not drown the ris-ing fire                            # copy(prechorus,1)

CHORUS 1
Leaves on stone, they fade a-way                          #
Names that time can-not be-tray                           # copy(chorus,1)
Whis-pers ride the wind to-night                          # transpose(chorus,1,3)
Truth can hide but not take flight                        # copy(chorus,3)

VERSE 2
A frag-ile truth be-tween two lies                        # 8,8,8,8 syllables
A vow once made be-neath the skies
She wrote it down in ink and flame
And signed it with an-oth-er's name

PRECHORUS 2
One voice lost a-mong the choir                           # 7,7 syllables
Can-not drown the ris-ing fire

CHORUS 2
Leaves on stone, they fade a-way                          # 8,8,8,8 syllables
Names that time can-not be-tray
Whis-pers ride the wind to-night
Truth can hide but not take flight

BRIDGE 1
Some-times si-lence speaks the most                       #
Words fall short and haunt like ghosts                    # copy(bridge,1)
Hope is sharp-er than a blade                             # transpose(bridge,1,-4)
But still it cuts the choice we made                      # copy(bridge,3)

CHORUS 3
Leaves on stone, they fade a-way                          # 8,8,8,8 syllables
Names that time can-not be-tray
Whis-pers ride the wind to-night
Truth can hide but not take flight

Ohhh-ohhh the bell at sea                                  # copy(intro,1)
Rings through time and mem-o-ry                            # transpose(outro,1,-2)
