VERSE 1
In the sha-dows of the an-cient tree                      #
Where the crys-tals sing their mel-o-dy                   # copy(verse,1)
War-riors gath-er with their blades held high             # transpose(verse,1,3)
Un-der-neath the star-lit sky                             # copy(verse,3)

PRECHORUS 1
Sum-mon forth the mag-ic light                            #

CHORUS 1
We are the cho-sen ones to-day                            #
Fight-ing for a bright-er way                             # copy(chorus,1)
Through the dark-ness we will rise                        # transpose(chorus,1,5)
With hope shin-ing in our eyes                            # copy(chorus,3)

VERSE 2
Drag-ons soar a-cross the moun-tain peaks                 # 8,8,8,7 syllables
While the earth be-neath us trem-bles weak
He-roes born from leg-ends old and true
Car-ry dreams for me and you

BRIDGE 1
When the world seems lost for-ev-er-more                  #
And the spir-its guard the sa-cred door                   # copy(bridge,1)
We'll re-mem-ber who we used to be                       # transpose(bridge,1,-2)
Fight for love and des-ti-ny                             # copy(bridge,3)

CHORUS 3
We are the cho-sen ones to-day                            # 8,7,8,7 syllables
Fight-ing for a bright-er way
Through the dark-ness we will rise
With hope shin-ing in our eyes
