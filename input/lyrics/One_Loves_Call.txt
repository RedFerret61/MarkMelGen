INTRO
Yeah, yeah, oh yeah                                       #
Yeah, yeah, oh yeah                                       # copy(intro,1)

VERSE 1
I see the chil-dren in the street                         #
With no shoes on their bleed-ing feet                     # copy(verse,1)
The sys-tem holds them in de-spair                        # transpose(verse,1,2)
But we must show them that we care                        # copy(verse,3)

PRECHORUS 1
Can you feel the sun a-ris-in'?                           #
Can you feel the love a-com-in'?                          # copy(prechorus,1)

CHORUS 1
One love call-in', can you hear it?                       #
Gath-er 'round, we must now share it                      # copy(chorus,1)
We must break the chains that bind us                     # transpose(chorus,1,4)
Then live in joy, yes, live in bliss                      # copy(chorus,3)

VERSE 2
The riv-ers flow to the sea, so free                      # 8,8,8,8 syllables
Just like our souls were meant to be
The moun-tains high and the val-leys low
In eve-ry heart, the love will grow

PRECHORUS 2
Can you feel the sun a-ris-in'?                           # 7,7 syllables
Can you feel the love a-com-in'?                          

CHORUS 2
One love call-in', can you hear it?                       # 8,8,8,8 syllables
Gath-er 'round, we must now share it
We must break the chains that bind us
Then live in joy, yes, live in bliss

BRIDGE 1
When the rain has stopped a-fall-in'                      #
And the bat-tle's end is call-in'                         # copy(bridge,1)
We'll stand firm on the high-er ground                    # transpose(bridge,1,-2)
With love, the on-ly truth we've found                    # copy(bridge,3)

CHORUS 3
One love call-in', can you hear it?                       # 8,8,8,8 syllables
Gath-er 'round, we must now share it
We must break the chains that bind us
Then live in joy, yes, live in bliss
