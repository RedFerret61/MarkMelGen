# Swan Song of the Heart
# Win-ter's Last Em-brace / Swan Song of the Heart / Rus-sian Souls in Spring
INTRO
A-cross the fro-zen step-pes of my heart #
Where win-ter winds have torn my dreams a-part # transpose(intro,1,4)

VERSE
In St. Pe-ters-burg the snow falls soft and white #
While I re-mem-ber our last ten-der night # invert(verse,1,Bb4)
The bal-let danc-ers spin in pearl and gold #
But emp-ty are the sto-ries they have told # reverse(verse,3)

PRECHORUS
Oh, how the or-ches-tra plays on #
Though my be-lov-ed heart is gone # transpose(prechorus,1,-3)

CHORUS
Like swans up-on a crys-tal lake of tears #
I glide through mem-o-ries of gold-en years # invert(chorus,1,F4)
The vi-o-lins weep with pas-sion-ate de-spair #
For love that van-ished in-to win-ter air # reverse(chorus,3)

VERSE
When spring re-turns to wake the sleep-ing earth # 9 syllables
Will it re-store my spir-it's sense of worth # transpose(verse,2,3)
The czar-ist pal-ace ech-oes with our song # 9 syllables
Of love that felt so right but went so wrong # invert(verse,4,D4)

Oh, how the or-ches-tra plays on # 7 syllables
Though my be-lov-ed heart is gone # 7 syllables

Like swans up-on a crys-tal lake of tears # 8 syllables
I glide through mem-o-ries of gold-en years # 9 syllables

For love that van-ished in-to win-ter air # 8 syllables

SOLO
In St. Pe-ters-burg the snow falls soft and white # copy(verse,1)
While I re-mem-ber our last ten-der night # invert(verse,2,Bb4)
The bal-let danc-ers spin in pearl and gold # transpose(verse,3,5)

Like Tat-ya-na writ-ing let-ters in the night #
I pour my soul out hop-ing you might write # invert(bridge,1,G4)
The Nut-crack-er may dance, the fai-ries sing #
But with-out love, there's no joy that they bring # transpose(bridge,3,-2)
