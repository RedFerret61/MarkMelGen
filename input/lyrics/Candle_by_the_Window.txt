INTRO
Mmm mm mm mm mm mm mm                                     #

VERSE 1
She wore a smi-le like the morn-ing sun                  #
Drift-ed through my life, then she was gone              # copy(verse,1)
Left her cup of tea, still warm and whole                # transpose(verse,1,2)
Took the words but nev-er stole my soul                  # copy(verse,3)

PRECHORUS 1
Shad-ows fall on ev-ry street I knew                    #
But there's still a spark that shines on through         # copy(prechorus,1)

CHORUS 1
Good-bye to yes-ter-day, it's time to let it go          #
I lit a flame, but winds still blow                      # copy(chorus,1)
I walk a-line be-tween the joy and pain                  # transpose(chorus,1,4)
Love's a song that won't re-frain                        # copy(chorus,3)

VERSE 2
That pi-a-no by the win-dow pane                         # 9,9,9,7 syllables
Still plays her laugh in soft re-frain
Ghosts of mem-ries dance a-cross the floor
She's not here, but I want more

PRECHORUS 2
Shad-ows fall on ev-ry street I knew                    # 8,9 syllables
But there's still a spark that shines on through

CHORUS 2
Good-bye to yes-ter-day, it's time to let it go          # 9,8,9,6 syllables
I lit a flame, but winds still blow
I walk a-line be-tween the joy and pain
Love's a song that won't re-frain

BRIDGE 1
She said 'nev-er wait for stars to fall'                 #
But I'm still wish-ing on them all                      # copy(bridge,1)
Cried her name in si-lence late last night              # transpose(bridge,1,-3)
Can't let go, but I might                                # copy(bridge,3)

CHORUS 3
Good-bye to yes-ter-day, it's time to let it go          # 9,8,9,6 syllables
I lit a flame, but winds still blow
I walk a-line be-tween the joy and pain
Love's a song that won't re-frain
