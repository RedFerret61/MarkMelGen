# When the Har-vest Moon Fades
INTRO
Down by the riv-er where the wil-lows bend #
Watch-ing the cur-rent car-ry dreams a-way # transpose(intro,1,4)

VERSE
There's a rust-ed train track run-ning through my mind #
Left there by the peo-ple I have lost # invert(verse,1,E4)
Old pho-to-graphs are fad-ing with the years #
Mem-o-ries like au-tumn leaves just blow a-way # reverse(verse,3)

PRECHORUS
Time keeps roll-ing on #
Like an old sad song # copy(prechorus,1)

CHORUS
When the har-vest moon fades in-to the dawn #
All the ghost-ly voic-es seem to call my name # transpose(chorus,1,-3)
Tell-ing me the sto-ries of the ones be-fore #
Who walked this land and felt the same sweet pain # invert(chorus,3,G4)

Fields of gold are turn-ing brown and dry # 8 syllables
Na-ture's way of tell-ing us we're mor-tal # reverse(verse,4)
