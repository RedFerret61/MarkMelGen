# This Sep-tem-ber Dream / Mid-night Cafe / One More Char-ade

INTRO
Doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo #
Doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo # copy(intro,1)

VERSE 1
The steam-ing cup on the ta-ble top #
I wish the clock would sim-ply stop # copy(verse,1)
I see your face in this dim light # transpose(verse,1,2)
A ghost from some Sep-tem-ber night # copy(verse,3)

CHORUS 1
And oh, that soft-ly haunt-ing tune #
Be-neath a pale and ha-zy moon # copy(chorus,1)
Was it all real, or just a scheme? # invert(chorus,1,C4)
This sweet Sep-tem-ber dream # copy(chorus,3)

VERSE 2
You smiled and asked me for the time # 8,8,7,7 syllables
A simp-le phrase, a per-fect rhyme
We talked for hours, drank the wine
And for a mo-ment, you were mine

CHORUS 2
And oh, that soft-ly haunt-ing tune # 8,8,8,6 syllables
Be-neath a pale and ha-zy moon
Was it all real, or just a scheme?
This sweet Sep-tem-ber dream

BRIDGE 1
The years drift by, the sea-sons turn #
A gen-tle les-son I must learn # copy(bridge,1)
That mem-o-ries may fade and glow # transpose(bridge,1,-3)
But where they lead, we nev-er know # copy(bridge,3)

SOLO
The steam-ing cup on the ta-ble top # copy(verse,1)
I wish the clock would sim-ply stop # copy(verse,2)
I see your face in this dim light # copy(verse,3)
A ghost from some Sep-tem-ber night # copy(verse,4)

CHORUS 3
And oh, that soft-ly haunt-ing tune # 8,8,8,6 syllables
Be-neath a pale and ha-zy moon
Was it all real, or just a scheme?
This sweet Sep-tem-ber dream

OUTRO
Doo doo doo, Sep-tem-ber dream #
Doo doo doo doo doo # copy(intro,1)
Doo doo doo... fade... # transpose(outro,1,5)
