INTRO  
rain-drops tap on the bro-ken street-lamp glass        #  
ra-dio hums a lone-ly me-lo-dic past                 # copy(intro,1)  

VERSE 1  
I watch the fa-ces drift be-neath the ne-on sky       #  
Each seam-less grin de-clares a sug-ar lie            # copy(verse,1)  
My mind de-ro-bes me in a dolls emp-ty cry           # transpose(verse,1,3)  
I mend the bro-ken chord with a si-lent sigh         # copy(verse,3)  

PRECHORUS 1  
And the laugh-ter rings but it cuts jus-tice thin     #  
While my ears bleed words I should neu-ver let in    # copy(prechorus,1)  

CHORUS 1  
Ton-ight I wan-der out in the chilled night air      #  
With heart un-done by the in-dif-fer-ent stare       # copy(chorus,1)  
I hum the sad tune that once filled my veins         # transpose(chorus,1,4)  
While black-ed re-morses dance in my brains          # copy(chorus,3)  

VERSE 2  
Rain clo-aks the blue in gray-ed cares               # 8,8,8,7 syllables  
I drift be-neath bleak-tin el-der-fairs  
Your laugh a ghost be-yond these gut-ter flames  
Where hope de-cays in sour-ing shames  

PRECHORUS 2  
And my re-flec-tion fades in street-lamp haze         # 7,7 syllables  
As I sur-round my-self with ner-vous gaze  

CHORUS 2  
Ton-ight I wan-der out in the chilled night air      # 8,7,8,7 syllables  
With heart un-done by the in-dif-fer-ent stare  
I hum the sad tune that once filled my veins  
While black-ed re-morses dance in my brains  

BRIDGE 1  
When the mi-rror shouts be-yond a fa-tal fault        #  
And prints my sins in ev-ery fleck of dust           # copy(bridge,1)  
I will drown the whis-pers chans-ing my sad re-volt  # transpose(bridge,1,-2)  
Be-fore the dark-est pride can turn to rust          # copy(bridge,3)  

CHORUS 3  
Ton-ight I wan-der out in the chilled night air      # 8,7,8,7 syllables  
With heart un-done by the in-dif-fer-ent stare  
I hum the sad tune that once filled my veins  
While black-ed re-morses dance in my brains  

SOLO  
I watch the fa-ces drift be-neath the ne-on sky       # copy(verse,1)

My mind de-ro-bes me in a dolls emp-ty cry           # copy(verse,3)  
I mend the bro-ken chord with a si-lent sigh         # copy(verse,4)  

CHORUS 4  
Ton-ight I wan-der out in the chilled night air      # 8,7,8,7 syllables  
With heart un-done by the in-dif-fer-ent stare  
I hum the sad tune that once filled my veins  
While black-ed re-morses dance in my brains
