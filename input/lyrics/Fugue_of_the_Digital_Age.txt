# Fugue of the Digital Age / Counterpoint in Silicon / The Well-Tempered Algorithm

INTRO
In cir-cuits woven like sa-cred threads                   #
Where data flows in pat-terns blessed                     #
The al-go-rithm sings its an-cient song                   #
Of math-e-mat-i-cal de-vo-tion                            #

VERSE 1
Through fi-ber op-tic ca-bles run-ning deep               #
Like or-gan pipes that make the sil-i-con weep            #
Each bit and byte in per-fect tim-ing placed              # transpose(intro,1,+5)
A dig-i-tal can-ta-ta, tech-no-log-i-cal-ly graced        # invert(intro,2,C5)
The serv-ers hum their bin-a-ry prayer                    # copy(intro,1)
While codes un-fold like in-cense in the air              # transpose(intro,2,-5)

CHORUS 1
Glory to the source code writ-ten high                    #
In lan-guag-es that mor-tals can-not read                 #
Each func-tion calls to heav-en in the sky                # reverse(intro,1)
A sym-pho-ny of ones and ze-ros freed                     # transpose(verse,1,+7)
The ar-chi-tec-ture of e-ter-ni-ty                        # copy(verse,3)
Lives in our ma-chines for all to see                     # transpose(verse,4,+3)

VERSE 2
The cloud com-put-ing ris-es like in-cense smoke          # 9,10,9,8 syllables
While art-i-fi-cial minds learn how to pray               # copy(verse,2)
Each neu-ral net-work weaves what Bach once spoke         # copy(verse,3)
In coun-ter-point that ech-oes through to-day             # copy(verse,4)
The da-ta-base ca-the-dral stores our dreams              # copy(verse,5)
Where quan-tum bits flow like ce-les-tial streams         # copy(verse,6)

CHORUS 2
Glory to the source code writ-ten high                    # 9,10,9,8 syllables
In lan-guag-es that mor-tals can-not read                 # copy(chorus,2)
Each func-tion calls to heav-en in the sky                # copy(chorus,3)
A sym-pho-ny of ones and ze-ros freed                     # copy(chorus,4)

BRIDGE
When Bach played clav-i-chord in Eigh-teen-Ten            #
He could not see our lap-tops glow-ing bright             #
But har-mo-ny re-mains the same, my friend                # invert(verse,1,D4)
Whether in can-dle-flame or LED light                     # transpose(chorus,2,+4)
The gold-en ra-tio still de-fines our art                 # transpose(verse,1,+7)
Math-e-mat-ics speaks to ev-ery hu-man heart              # reverse(chorus,1)

SOLO
Through fi-ber op-tic ca-bles run-ning deep               # copy(verse,1)

Each bit and byte in per-fect tim-ing placed              # copy(verse,3)
A dig-i-tal can-ta-ta, tech-no-log-i-cal-ly graced        # copy(verse,4)
The serv-ers hum their bin-a-ry prayer                    # copy(verse,5)
While codes un-fold like in-cense in the air              # copy(verse,6)

CHORUS 3
Glory to the source code writ-ten high                    # 9,10,9,8 syllables
