INTRO
Hus-tlers move, we ne-ver rest			    # 7 syl-la-bles
Side gigs stack, I make it best			    # reverse(intro,1)
Clock-in late but cash still flows			# copy(intro,1)
Flip that stack, watch how it grows			# reverse(intro,1)

VERSE 1
Dawn to dusk, I'm on the grind			    # 7 syl-la-bles
Nine-to-five then cash on-line			    # copy(verse,1)
Sell-ing beats and flip-ping kicks			# 7 syl-la-bles
Code by night, make mon-ey quick			# copy(verse,3)

PRECHORUS
Move that weight, no time to stall			# 7 syl-la-bles
Hus-tle hard, I want it all			        # transpose(prechorus,1, 2)
Stack it up and count it twice			    # 7 syl-la-bles
Ev-'ry play, I'm roll-ing dice			    # transpose(prechorus,3, 2)

CHORUS
Hus-tle, grind, stack that dough		    # 6,6,7,7 syl-la-bles
Ev-'ry move, watch it grow			        # copy(chorus,1)
Mul-ti-ple streams, stay-ing paid			# 
I Built this all, I'm self-made			    # copy(chorus,3)

Drop-ships move, I'm on the net		        # 7 syl-la-bles
Pro-fits rise, ain't seen 'em yet			# 7 syl-la-bles
