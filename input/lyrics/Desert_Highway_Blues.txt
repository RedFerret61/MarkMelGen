# Des-ert High-way Blues
INTRO
There's a lone-ly stretch of as-phalt       # 8 syllables
Wind-ing through the des-ert night          # 6 syllables
Where the tum-ble-weed keeps roll-ing       #   copy(intro, 1)
And the stars shine way too bright          #   copy(intro, 2)

VERSE 1
I was driv-ing through Ne-va-da             # 8 syllables
In my rust-ed Chev-ro-let                   # 6 syllables
Think-ing 'bout the girl I left be-hind     #   copy(verse, 1)
And the debts I'll nev-er pay               #   copy(verse, 2)
She had eyes like morn-ing dia-monds        #   transpose(verse, 1, 3)
And a heart made out of stone               #   transpose(verse, 2, 3)
Now I'm chas-ing west-ern sun-sets          #   copy(verse, 1)
Try-ing to find my way back home            #   copy(verse, 2)

PRECHORUS
The ra-di-o keeps play-ing                  # 7 syllables
Those old famil-iar songs                   # 6 syllables
Tell-ing me I'm go-ing                      #   copy(prechorus, 2)
Some-where I don't be-long                  #   transpose(prechorus, 2, -2)

CHORUS
On this des-ert high-way                    # 6 syllables
Where the lost souls ride                   # 5 syllables
Run-ning from to-mor-row                    #   copy(chorus, 1)
With no-where left to hide                  #   copy(chorus, 2)
The mi-rage keeps call-ing                  #   transpose(chorus, 1, 4)
But it's just an-oth-er lie                 #   invert(chorus, 1, C4)
On this des-ert high-way                    #   copy(chorus, 1)
Where the dream-ers come to die             #   copy(chorus, 6)

VERSE 2
Passed a bil-lion dol-lar ca-si-no     # 8 syllables  # copy(verse, 1)
Full of brok-en prom-is-es     # 6 syllables  # copy(verse, 2)
Where the neon lights are flash-ing     # 8 syllables  # transpose(verse, 1, -3)
Like fad-ed mem-or-ies     # 6 syllables  # transpose(verse, 2, -3)
Met a girl in Reno with a     # 8 syllables  # copy(verse, 5)
Suit-case full of shattered dreams     # 6 syllables  # copy(verse, 6)
Said she came here look-ing for     # 8 syllables  # copy(verse, 7)
Some-thing more than what it seems     # 6 syllables  # copy(verse, 8)

May-be some-day I'll find           # 5 syllables
What I'm look-ing for               # 5 syllables
Some-thing real be-hind             # copy(bridge, 1)
These neon-lit doors                # copy(bridge, 2)
But to-night I'm just an-oth-er     # transpose(verse, 1, -5)
Stran-ger pass-ing through          # transpose(verse, 2, -5)
Car-ry-ing all this bag-gage        # copy(bridge, 5)
That I can't un-do                  # reverse(bridge, 2)
