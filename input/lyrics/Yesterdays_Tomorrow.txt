INTRO
La la la la la la la                                       #
La la la la la la la                                       # copy(intro,1)

VERSE 1
Walk-ing down the street where mem-o-ries grow             #
See-ing all the fac-es that I used to know                # copy(verse,1)
Chil-dren play-ing games be-neath the oak                 # transpose(verse,1,2)
Life's a gen-tle, sweet-ly spo-ken joke                   # copy(verse,3)

PRECHORUS 1
And the sun shines bright to-day                          #
Wash-ing all my fears a-way                               # copy(prechorus,1)

CHORUS 1
Yes-ter-day's to-mor-row here                            #
Danc-ing through the at-mos-phere                        # copy(chorus,1)
Hold me close and don't let go                           # transpose(chorus,1,4)
That's the on-ly thing I know                            # copy(chorus,3)

VERSE 2
Sit-ting by the fire-place dream-ing dreams               # 8,8,7,8 syllables
Noth-ing's quite the way it real-ly seems
Mu-sic box-es play their tune
Un-der-neath the sil-ver moon

Hold me close and don't let go
That's the on-ly thing I know

BRIDGE 1
When the world gets too con-fus-ing                       #
And you feel like you're los-ing                         # copy(bridge,1)
All the mag-ic that you knew                             # transpose(bridge,1,-3)
Just re-mem-ber love is true                             # invert(bridge,3,G4)

Hold me close and don't let go
That's the on-ly thing I know
