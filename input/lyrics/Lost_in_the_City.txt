# Lost in the Cit-y 
# / Al-ter-nate Tues-days / What the World Needs Now is You
INTRO
Walk-ing down Fifth Av-e-nue at half past three #
Won-der-ing if you'll ev-er think of me # transpose(intro,1,3)

VERSE
I see cou-ples hold-ing hands in Cen-tral Park #
While I'm still search-ing for that miss-ing spark # invert(verse,1,Eb4)
Ev-ery rain-drop on my win-dow seems to say #
You're the one who got a-way # reverse(verse,3)

PRECHORUS
May-be I should call you #
May-be I should write # transpose(prechorus,1,-2)
May-be if I try hard #
I can make it right # invert(prechorus,3,G4)

CHORUS
Lost in the cit-y with-out your love #
Like a song with-out words I'm dream-ing of # copy(chorus,1)
All these peo-ple rush-ing by me #
But no-bod-y can see what I need # reverse(chorus,3)

Cock-tail par-ties filled with emp-ty con-ver-sa-tion # 11 syllables
Can't re-place this lone-ly des-per-a-tion # transpose(verse,2,4)

Think-ing of our hap-py years # invert(verse,4,F4)

SOLO
I see cou-ples hold-ing hands in Cen-tral Park # copy(verse,1)
While I'm still search-ing for that miss-ing spark # invert(verse,2,Eb4)

BRIDGE
Some-times love is just a mat-ter of tim-ing #
