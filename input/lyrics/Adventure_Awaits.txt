Jump-ing through the clouds to-day                       #

VERSE 1
Pack your bag and grab your hat                         #
Ad-ven-ture waits where dreams are at                   #
Cas-tles high and val-leys green                        # copy(intro,2)
Mag-ic in the air un-seen                               # transpose(intro,1,+5)

CHORUS 1
Come a-long the path un-folds                           #
Stor-ies wait-ing to be told                            #
Jump and run through morn-ing light                     # copy(verse,1)

When the night falls down                               #
