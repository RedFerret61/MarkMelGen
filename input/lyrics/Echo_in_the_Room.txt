# Echo_in_the_Room
# Echo in the Room / Second Hand Sun / Glass and Smoke

INTRO
Just a sha-dow #
On the wall now #


VERSE 1
I keep your old coat hang-ing by the door #
Don't know what I am wait-ing for #
The scent of rain and win-ter nights # copy(verse,1)
Liv-ing un-der fad-ed lights # transpose(verse,2,-5)


PRECHORUS 1
And was it real-ly all so long a-go? #
Some-times I just don't know # copy(prechorus,1)


CHORUS 1
And there's an ech-o in the room where you should be #
It's just the ghost of you and the mem-o-ry of me #
A con-ver-sa-tion that will nev-er find an end # transpose(verse,1,+3)
Tell me when does the heal-ing be-gin # copy(verse,2)


VERSE 2
I tried to change the fur-ni-ture a-round #
Hoped to nev-er hear that lone-ly sound #
But ev-ery foot-step on the floor # invert(chorus,1,C4)
Sounds like you com-ing back for more # copy(verse,1)


PRECHORUS 2
The sea-sons turn but I am stand-ing still #
And I won-der if I al-ways will # copy(prechorus,1)


CHORUS 2
And there's an ech-o in the room where you should be # 11,12,12,8 syllables
It's just the ghost of you and the mem-o-ry of me # copy(chorus,2)
A con-ver-sa-tion that will nev-er find an end # copy(chorus,3)
Tell me when does the heal-ing be-gin # copy(chorus,4)


BRIDGE
And oh, the si-lence is a storm I can't out-run #
Chas-ing af-ter a sec-ond hand sun #
Was it all just glass and smoke to you? # transpose(chorus,1,-7)
Tell me you ev-er felt it too # reverse(bridge,2)


SOLO
And there's an ech-o in the room where you should be # copy(chorus,1)
It's just the ghost of you and the mem-o-ry of me # copy(chorus,2)
A con-ver-sa-tion that will nev-er find an end # copy(chorus,3)
Tell me when does the heal-ing be-gin # copy(chorus,4)


CHORUS 3
And there's an ech-o in the room where you should be # 11,12,12,8 syllables
It's just the ghost of you and the mem-o-ry of me # transpose(chorus,2,+2)
A con-ver-sa-tion that will nev-er find an end # invert(chorus,3,G4)
Tell me when does the heal-ing be-gin # copy(chorus,4)


OUTRO
The heal-ing be-gin # copy(chorus,4)
Just an ech-o # transpose(intro,1,-12)
An ech-o now #
In the room # copy(chorus,1)
