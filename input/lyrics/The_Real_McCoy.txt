INTRO
Doo-doo-doo in Cop-per Sky                                #
Doo-doo-doo the clouds roll by                             # copy(intro,1)

VERSE 1
Down by the docks where the hush mon-ey flows             #
Steam from the gut-ter and the neon glows                 # copy(verse,1)
Sid and Lou play five-card sin in the rain                # transpose(verse,1,2)
Ev-ery jack bets high, ev-ery queen feigns pain           # copy(verse,3)

PRECHORUS 1
We saw the pearl di-ver smile                             #
Right be-fore he sank a mile                              # copy(prechorus,1)

CHORUS 1
Ain't no luck in the Real Mc-Coy                          #
Just a gold-toothed laugh and a bro-ken toy               # copy(chorus,1)
They trade you dreams for a fifth of gin                  # transpose(chorus,1,4)
And leave you danc-ing in the spin                        # copy(chorus,3)

VERSE 2
Moon-light falls on a flam-ing car                        # 9,8,8,7 syllables
Jones lit the fuse at the Zig-Zag Bar
El-la plays the crys-tal glass with grace
But sings for no one in this place

PRECHORUS 2
We saw the pearl di-ver smile                             # 7,7 syllables
Right be-fore he sank a mile

CHORUS 2
Ain't no luck in the Real Mc-Coy                          # 8,9,8,7 syllables
Just a gold-toothed laugh and a bro-ken toy
They trade you dreams for a fifth of gin
And leave you danc-ing in the spin

BRIDGE 1
Whis-key dreams and fake good-byes                        #
Spin like tapes in old ca-sat-te skies                    # copy(bridge,1)
The crook's con-fess-ion's re-cord-ed clean               # transpose(bridge,1,-4)
But no one's sure just what it means                      # copy(bridge,3)

CHORUS 3
Ain't no luck in the Real Mc-Coy                          # 8,9,8,7 syllables
Just a gold-toothed laugh and a bro-ken toy
They trade you dreams for a fifth of gin
And leave you danc-ing in the spin

SOLO
Down by the docks where the hush mon-ey flows             # copy(verse,1)

Sid and Lou play five-card sin in the rain                # copy(verse,3)

CHORUS 4
Ain't no luck in the Real Mc-Coy                          # 8,9,8,7 syllables

They trade you dreams for a fifth of gin
And leave you danc-ing in the spin
