INTRO
Moon-light spill-ing on the floor                         #
Still wait-ing by your door                               # copy(intro,1)

VERSE 1
I wore red and you wore doubt                             #
Both too proud to talk it out                             # copy(verse,1)
Late-night words we left un-said                          # transpose(verse,1,2)
Still ring-ing in my head                                 # copy(verse,3)

PRECHORUS 1
You pulled a-way, I let you go                            #
Now I'm lost in what I know                               # copy(prechorus,1)

CHORUS 1
This is me say-ing I'm sor-ry now                         #
Wish-ing I could turn time a-round                        # copy(chorus,1)
Ev-'ry tear I cried was true                              # transpose(chorus,1,4)
Still in love with los-ing you                            # copy(chorus,3)

VERSE 2
Friends all say I should move on                          # 8,8,8,6 syllables
But they don't know what is gone
Pic-tures burn but mem-ories stay
You were my one yes-ter-day

PRECHORUS 2
You pulled a-way, I let you go                            # 8,8 syllables
Now I'm lost in what I know

CHORUS 2
This is me say-ing I'm sor-ry now                         # 8,8,8,7 syllables
Wish-ing I could turn time a-round
Ev-'ry tear I cried was true
Still in love with los-ing you

BRIDGE 1
If I could take one step back in time                     #
I'd kiss you in that sil-ly line                          # copy(bridge,1)
Re-write ev-'ry mis-take we made                         # transpose(bridge,1,-2)
Keep you close and nev-er fade                           # copy(bridge,3)

CHORUS 3
This is me say-ing I'm sor-ry now                         # 8,8,8,7 syllables
Wish-ing I could turn time a-round
Ev-'ry tear I cried was true
Still in love with los-ing you

SOLO

Late-night words we left un-said                          # copy(verse,3)
