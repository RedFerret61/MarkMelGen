VERSE 1
Walk-ing down the emp-ty street to-night                   #
Neon signs are flash-ing red and white                     # copy(verse,1)
Think-ing of the days when you were here                   # transpose(verse,1,3)
Wish-ing you were stand-ing near                          # copy(verse,3)

PRECHORUS 1
But the mu-sic starts to play                             #
Wash-ing all my tears a-way                               # copy(prechorus,1)

CHORUS 1
I am dan-cing in the rain                                 #
Feel-ing free from all the pain                          # copy(chorus,1)
Let the thun-der roll a-bove                             # transpose(chorus,1,5)
I don't need your kind of love                           # copy(chorus,3)

VERSE 2
Sum-mer came and went like yes-ter-day                    # 8,8,8,7 syllables
All our dreams just seemed to fade a-way
Now I'm stronger than I used to be
Fi-nal-ly I can see

CHORUS 2
I am dan-cing in the rain                                 # 8,7,8,7 syllables
Feel-ing free from all the pain
Let the thun-der roll a-bove
I don't need your kind of love

BRIDGE 1
When the world gets cold and grey                         #
And there's noth-ing left to say                         # copy(bridge,1)
I'll re-mem-ber how to smile                             # transpose(bridge,1,-2)
Live my life in my own style                             # copy(bridge,3)

Let the thun-der roll a-bove
I don't need your kind of love
